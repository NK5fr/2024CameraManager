!List of parameters visible in the wizards.
!-------------------------------------------------
!You can write comments by writing a line with a "!".
! "|" is considered as a separator. Don't use it in your strings, or you might have cut strings and others undesirable effects!

!All parameters need to be put in the order they are written to keep the same order in the wizard.
!All parameters follow the same pattern:
!First, you write the parameter number in the file.
!Then you write its type: 
!-"category" for a new category
!-"cmbBox" for a new comboBox, which contains a list of string values
!-"int" for a new integer parameter, represented by a spinbox.
!-"path" for a path parameter.
!Next, type of parameters need a name to distinguish them from others, and have other options:
!-"category" only need a name, and have no options.
!-"cmbBox" have one or multiple couples of showed value/real Values. Write all possible values you can have.
!-"int" can have (but is not obliged to) a minimum value and a maximum value.
!-"path" use 1 optional value: "folder" which indicates that the parameter is a folder path and not a file one. By default, the parameter is considered as a file path.
